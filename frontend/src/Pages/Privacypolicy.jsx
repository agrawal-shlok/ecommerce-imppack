            We use Razorpay for processing payments. We/Razorpay do not store your card data on their servers. 
            The data is encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) when processing

            transaction. After that is complete, your purchase transaction information is not saved. <br /><br />
            Our payment gateway adheres to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards 
            Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover. 
            PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our store and its 
            service providers. For more insight, you may also want to read the terms and conditions of Razorpay on
